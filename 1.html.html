<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/"
  target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard <strong>markup <u>language</u> for documents</strong> designed to be displayed in a web browser. ... HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.

Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages within a web browser, usage of the shells of operating systems (OS), embedded systems, as well as numerous games. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, it is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes.</p>
