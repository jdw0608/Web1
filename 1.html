  target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard <strong>markup <u>language</u> for documents</strong> designed to be displayed in a web browser. ... HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.

</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Primitives are usually the elementary tasks or API calls[clarification needed], and the language allows them to be combined into more programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages within a web browser, usage of the shells of operating systems (OS), embedded systems, as well as numerous games. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, it is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes.</p>
